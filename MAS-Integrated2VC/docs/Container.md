# Container.java Documentation

## Overview

`Container.java` is a part of the MultiAgentSystem that is responsible for starting and managing the agent environment. It sets up the basic structure needed for agents (such as robots) to run and interact within the system.

## What It Does

- **Starts the Agent Container:** It initializes the environment where agents will operate. This is like setting up a workspace where all agents can be created and managed.
- **Creates Agents:** It creates and starts specific agents, such as the robot agent, so they can begin performing their tasks.
- **Configures the Environment:** It sets up properties for the agent environment, such as enabling a graphical user interface for monitoring.
- **Handles Errors:** If there are any problems during setup, it catches and prints the errors so they can be addressed.

## How It Is Used

- **System Initialization:** When the MultiAgentSystem starts, `Container.java` is called to set up the agent environment.
- **Agent Management:** It is responsible for creating and starting the agents that will perform the main logic and actions in the system.
- **Monitoring:** By enabling the graphical user interface, it allows users to see what agents are running and monitor their activity.

## Concepts

- **Agent Container:** The environment where all agents live and operate. It manages the lifecycle of agents.
- **Agents:** Software entities (like robots) that perform actions and make decisions within the system.
- **Environment Properties:** Settings that control how the agent environment behaves, such as whether a GUI is shown.

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization:** The agent container is started and configured.
2. **Agent Creation:** Agents are created and started within the container.
3. **Operation:** Agents perform their tasks, and the environment manages their execution.
